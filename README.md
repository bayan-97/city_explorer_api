 you will begin building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application

## Getting Started
1. Repository Set Up
2. Locations: As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see data about the area of interest to me.
3. Weather: As a user, I want to request current weather information so that I can learn more about the typical weather patterns in the location I had entered.
4. Errors: As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
